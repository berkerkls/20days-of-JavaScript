# Dom Array Methods

* This project is made by using JavaScript and for practice some array methods like reduce, sort, filter, forEach and async and await etc.

* In this project I used http://randomuser.me/api which you can take random people to your array and use that for practice.

-In project there are five different buttons which they are,

-Add User(I used push() method to add user into array)
-Double Money(I used map() method to double each user's money)
-Show Only Millionaires( I used filter() method to see only millionaires in my main)
-Sort by Richest(I used sort() method to see user's money in descending way.)
-Calculate Entire Wealth(I used reduce() method to accumulate entire wealth and put that into the dom.)
