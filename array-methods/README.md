# Dom Array Methods

* This project is made by using JavaScript and for practice some array methods like reduce, sort, filter, forEach and async and await etc.

* In this project I used http://randomuser.me/api which you can take random people to your array and use that for practice.

* In project there are five different buttons which they are,

*Add User(I used push() method to add user into array)
*Double Money(I used map() method to double each user's money)
*Show Only Millionaires( I used filter() method to see only millionaires in my main)
*Sort by Richest(I used sort() method to see user's money in descending way.)
*Calculate Entire Wealth(I used reduce() method to accumulate entire wealth and put that into the dom.)
