# Custom Video Player

**In this video player I used basic html video API and add the controls by myself in the project by using font-awesome.com**

-For the progress bar I use css-tricks.com which is pretty helpful website for every project.

-You can start, pause, stop the video by using the controls that I added in Html and make them functinal in JavaScript folder.

-You can see the UI of the project here.
